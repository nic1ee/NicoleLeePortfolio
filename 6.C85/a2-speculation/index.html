    <p>
      This report explores neighborhood-level trends in corporate ownership and occupancy in Boston over the last 20 years.
      I focus on (1) where corporate ownership is most concentrated today, (2) how patterns have changed since 2004, and
      (3) whether corporate ownership is associated with neighborhood context, including racial composition and housing vacancy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Initial Questions (Motivation)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Q1: Where is corporate ownership most concentrated in 2024?</strong>
        Motivation: “Homes for Profit” argues investor activity is unevenly distributed; I wanted to identify which neighborhoods have the highest rates today.</li>
      <li><strong>Q2: Which neighborhoods saw the biggest growth in corporate ownership from 2004 to 2024?</strong>
        Motivation: The report emphasizes increasing investor presence over time; I wanted to see whether growth is citywide or concentrated in specific areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Q3: Is corporate ownership associated with neighborhood demographics or vacancy in 2024?</strong>
        Motivation: “Homes for Profit” discusses displacement pressures and investor strategies; vacancy may reflect turnover and/or units held off-market.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Phase 1 — Overview: Concentration and Change Over Time</h2>

        <div class="caption-title">Figure 1 — Corporate ownership is concentrated in a small set of dense, central neighborhoods (2024).</div>
        In 2024, the highest corporate ownership rates cluster in neighborhoods such as South Boston Waterfront, Fenway, Longwood, Downtown, and Beacon Hill.
        The top-10 range spans roughly ~0.28 to ~0.38, indicating meaningful variation even among the most corporate-owned areas.
        This pattern suggests corporate ownership is especially prevalent in high-demand, dense markets where rental housing and redevelopment are common.

        <div class="caption-title">Figure 2 — Corporate ownership increased across every Boston neighborhood from 2004 to 2024.</div>
        All neighborhoods show a positive change in corporate ownership over the 20-year window, suggesting citywide growth rather than a purely localized phenomenon.
        The largest increases appear in South Boston Waterfront and several central neighborhoods, consistent with areas that have experienced major development and price growth.
        Notably, many primarily residential neighborhoods (e.g., Dorchester, Mattapan, Hyde Park) also increase, indicating diffusion beyond the downtown core.

    <h2 class="section-title">Phase 2 — Investigating Context: Demographics and Vacancy (2024)</h2>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/05_corp_vs_nonwhite_2024.png" alt="Corporate ownership vs non-white population share in 2024">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="caption-title">Figure 3 — Corporate ownership is not strongly aligned with neighborhood racial composition (2024).</div>
        The scatter shows neighborhoods with high corporate ownership spanning a wide range of non-white population shares, and vice versa.
        This weak relationship suggests corporate ownership in Boston is not exclusively concentrated in either majority-white or majority-nonwhite neighborhoods.
        Instead, corporate ownership likely reflects a combination of housing stock, density, and market dynamics that cut across demographic contexts.

    <figure>
      <img src="img/06_corp_vs_vacancy_2024.png" alt="Corporate ownership vs vacancy rate in 2024">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="caption-title">Figure 4 — Higher corporate ownership tends to coincide with higher vacancy (2024), with notable outliers.</div>
        Compared to the demographics plot, the vacancy relationship appears more structured: neighborhoods with higher corporate ownership often show higher vacancy rates.
        A few upper-right points suggest neighborhoods with both high corporate ownership and unusually high vacancy, potentially consistent with investor-held units, luxury turnover, or housing held off-market.
        However, the spread indicates vacancy is not explained by corporate ownership alone and may depend on neighborhood-specific housing stock and development patterns.

      <img src="img/07_corp_vs_vacancy_regression_2024.png" alt="Corporate ownership vs vacancy rate with regression line in 2024">
      <figcaption>
        <div class="caption-title">Figure 5 — A regression line highlights a positive association between corporate ownership and vacancy (2024).</div>
        Adding a fitted line makes the direction of the relationship clearer: vacancy generally rises as corporate ownership increases.
        This refinement supports the hypothesis that neighborhoods with greater corporate ownership may experience higher levels of unoccupied housing stock.
        Future analysis could label the extreme points to identify which neighborhoods drive the strongest vacancy outcomes and whether they correspond to specific development types (e.g., luxury high-rises).

    <h2 class="section-title">Main Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Corporate ownership in 2024 is highest in a small set of dense, central neighborhoods, but rates vary meaningfully even within the “top” group.</li>
      <li>From 2004–2024, corporate ownership rises across all Boston neighborhoods, suggesting broad growth rather than a single-neighborhood effect.</li>
      <li>In 2024, corporate ownership is not strongly determined by neighborhood racial composition, but it shows a clearer positive association with vacancy.</li>
      <li>High corporate ownership + high vacancy outliers may reflect investor behavior or housing stock dynamics worth deeper investigation in a final project.</li>
    </ul>

      Notes on transformations: I computed <code>nonwhite_share = 1 - (white_all / tot_pop_all)</code> and
      <code>vacancy_rate = vacant_unit / tot_unit</code>. I compared corporate ownership rates between 2004 and 2024 by merging neighborhood records and computing the difference.
