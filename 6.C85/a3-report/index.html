      <p><strong>Insights about the data/visualization:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>The U.S. experienced multiple COVID waves from 2020 to early 2022.</li>
        <li>Winter surges are consistently the largest, especially winter 2020–21 and January 2022.</li>
        <li>The Omicron spike in January 2022 is dramatically larger than any previous wave.</li>
        <li>2021 shows several rises and declines, including a summer/fall surge (Delta).</li>
        <li>Case levels generally increase over time, with later waves reaching higher magnitudes.</li>
        <li>The 7-day average smooths daily noise and makes overall trends clearer.</li>
        <li>The article emphasizes that January 2022 would likely set a record for total cases.</li>
        <li>The key message is about timing (early-to-mid January peak) and scale (millions of cases per week).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Design Critique:</strong></p>

      <p>
        The spiral chart is visually compelling and does a good job reinforcing the idea of repeated seasonal waves.
        It immediately communicated to me that cases rise and fall over time and makes the Omicron spike feel dramatic and unprecedented.
        As a lead image in an opinion piece, it works well to capture attention and signal urgency.
        The use of a 7-day average also helps reduce daily volatility and makes the overall wave patterns readable.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the spiral format makes precise comparisons difficult.
        Because magnitude is encoded as distance from the center and wrapped around a circle, it is hard to compare peaks across years or clearly judge scale.
        The reference mark (150K cases) is subtle, and there is no consistent axis anchoring values throughout the chart.
        As a result, readers likely understand the general story that Omicron is huge, but may struggle to quantify exactly how much larger it is than previous waves.
        A clearer design could use a linear time axis or stronger annotations to better support the article’s central claim about the timing and magnitude of the January 2022 peak.

      <h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <!-- Sketch 1 -->
      <figure>
        <img src="images/1.jpg" alt="Sketch 1" />
        <figcaption>
          Sketch 1: Linear timeline showing 7-day average cases with vertical markers for major waves.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p><strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>I wanted to move away from the spiral and use a clean linear timeline so comparisons across waves are easier.</li>
        <li>The goal was to clearly show increasing peak magnitudes over time and visually mark major waves like Winter 2020–21, Delta, and Omicron.</li>
        <li>This design makes it easier to compare height and timing directly.</li>
        <li>However, it only shows cases and does not directly address the “relative death wave” idea.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Sketch 2 -->
      <figure>
        <img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Sketch 2" />
        <figcaption>
          Sketch 2: Major waves aligned by “days since surge began” to compare shape and growth speed.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p><strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Here I wanted to compare the shape and speed of each wave more directly.</li>
        <li>By aligning waves by “days since surge began,” it becomes easier to compare how quickly Omicron rose relative to prior waves.</li>
        <li>This emphasizes Omicron’s rapid acceleration.</li>
        <li>However, this removes the broader pandemic timeline context and may be less intuitive for a general audience.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Sketch 3 -->
      <figure>
        <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="Sketch 3" />
        <figcaption>
          Sketch 3: Focused comparison between Winter 2020–21 and Omicron with shaded emphasis.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p><strong>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>This sketch narrows the focus to the key comparison: Winter 2020–21 versus Omicron.</li>
        <li>I used shading to emphasize the two major waves and visually compare magnitude.</li>
        <li>This approach directly supports the article’s central claim.</li>
        <li>In my final design, I attempted to emulate aspects of this sketch, particularly the emphasis on comparing peak magnitudes and clearly highlighting Omicron.</li>
        <li>However, the exact shaded comparison approach did not translate cleanly into the final digital version, especially once I introduced deaths and dual axes, so I adjusted the design while keeping the core comparison intact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>

      <h2>Final Writeup</h2>

      <p>
        My final design focuses on clearly communicating the central claim that Omicron produced record-breaking case counts but did not generate a proportionally large death wave.
        Rather than using the spiral format from the original visualization, I chose a linear time-series line chart to make comparisons across waves more direct and legible.
        The primary goal was to allow viewers to easily compare magnitude between Winter 2020–21 and January 2022.
        By plotting 7-day average new cases and new deaths across the full pandemic timeline, the visualization emphasizes peak comparison and proportional differences between waves.
        The shaded band marking the Omicron period and the limited use of annotations direct attention to the key contrast: cases reached their highest level in January 2022, but deaths did not surpass the prior winter peak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Position along a shared time axis is the primary encoding, leveraging its perceptual accuracy for comparing trends over time.
        A dual-axis structure was retained to preserve the natural scale differences between cases and deaths, but both axes are clearly labeled to reduce confusion.
        Muted but distinct colors differentiate cases and deaths without overwhelming the viewer, and the 7-day average transformation reduces daily reporting noise while preserving overall patterns.
        Annotations are intentionally minimal and placed only at major peaks to avoid clutter while reinforcing the narrative.
        Through the critique-by-redesign process, I realized that while Sketch 3’s focused shading approach was conceptually strong, it was more difficult to execute cleanly in the final version without sacrificing clarity.
        Ultimately, prioritizing temporal clarity and direct magnitude comparison proved more effective for communicating the article’s claim than maintaining the spiral’s visual novelty.
